# Cross-Domain Burmese N-gram Language Modeling

## Overview

This project trains Burmese n-gram language models with KenLM, SRILM, and Neural LM (LSTM) on a shared corpus, then compares toolkit performance and perplexity across news, legal, and religious test domains to study cross-domain generalization.

## Dataset
### Train Data
- [Myanmar ALT](https://www2.nict.go.jp/astrec-att/member/mutiyama/ALT/my-alt-190530.zip) from [ALT Treebank Corpus](https://www2.nict.go.jp/astrec-att/member/mutiyama/ALT/)
- [Sayar's myPos version 3.0](https://github.com/ye-kyaw-thu/myPOS/blob/master/corpus-ver-3.0/corpus/mypos-ver.3.0.txt)
- https://huggingface.co/datasets/URajinda/myanmar_spoken_corpus_v4_cleaned (Discarded later due to RAM issue)

### Test Data

- Custom data in the news article domain (from [BBC Burmese International News](https://www.bbc.com/burmese/topics/cnlv9j1z93wt))
- Custom data in the legal document domain (from [မြန်မာနိုင်ငံကူးလက်မှတ်ဆိုင်ရာဥပဒေ](https://www.moi.gov.mm/file-download/download/public/103555) published by the Myanmar Ministry of Information)
- Custom data in the religious text domain (from [ခန္ဓဝိပဿနာဘာဝနာ](https://18milecdn.myanmarseo.com/file/18mile-cdn/books/%E1%80%81%E1%80%94%E1%80%B9%E1%80%93%E1%80%9D%E1%80%AD%E1%80%95%E1%80%BF%E1%80%94%E1%80%AC%20%E1%80%98%E1%80%AC%E1%80%9D%E1%80%94%E1%80%AC.pdf) by 18 Miles Sayardaw)

## Data Collection & Preprocessing

### Train Data
Training data come from existing corpora: word tags are removed, the sources are merged, then passed through syllable normalization (`syl-normalizer`) and OppaWord segmentation to produce the final train corpus.

In `prep_train_data_v1`, the Hugging Face spoken corpus was included; the merged file exceeded 3 GB and could not be loaded on a machine with limited RAM. `prep_train_data_v2` drops that corpus and uses only the ALT and myPOS datasets.

### Test Data
Test domains were chosen manually, collected by hand, and preprocessed with the same pipeline (punctuation/tag cleaning, syllable normalization, OppaWord). Sentences are split on Burmese full stops (`။`); very short lines (e.g. legal section numbers) are dropped. Remaining syllables are realigned into a fixed grid of 20 syllables per line and 15 lines per document (300 syllables per document), with the same document count across all three domains. The balanced outputs are saved as `*.cleaned.state4`.
